Is my string palindrome?
===

I come up with idea of making is_palindrome function that works in O(1) !

Sounds like magic? Maybe, but it's real.

## How to get this code?

+ Just download `palidrome.py` file
+ import is_palindrome function and use it!

```python
>>> from palindrome import is_palindrome
>>> is_palindrome("aba")
True
>>> 
```


> works only with lowercase ascii letters
